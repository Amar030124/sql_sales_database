# üõí Retail Sales Data Analysis using PostgreSQL

This project performs SQL-based analysis on a retail sales dataset using PostgreSQL. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to derive meaningful insights from transactional data like customer behavior, product category trends, and sales performance.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `SQL - Retail Sales Analysis_utf.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `SQL Query Questions for Retail Sales Analysis.docx`: Document containing the SQL queries used in this project.
- `queries.sql`: (Optional) SQL file with all queries for quick execution.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## üß† Objectives

- Perform basic data exploration using SQL.
- Solve business-related queries including customer segmentation, product category analysis, and sales trends.
- Use PostgreSQL functions like `GROUP BY`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `DISTINCT`, `RANK()`, and `EXTRACT()`.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information such as:
- `sale_date`: Date of the transaction.
- `customer_id`: Unique ID for each customer.
- `category`: Product category (e.g., Clothing, Beauty, etc.).
- `total_sale`: Amount of the sale.
- `gender`, `age`: Customer demographics.
- `quantity`: Number of items sold.

## üìù Key SQL Queries

Here are a few examples of the queries used:

- Total number of sales:
  ```sql

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM Sales_table;

Unique customers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM Sales_table;

Total sales per category:
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale FROM Sales_table GROUP BY category;


Top 5 highest-spending customers:
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM Sales_table
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;


Best-performing sales month:
SELECT year, month, avg_sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
      AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sales,
      RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM Sales_table
    GROUP BY year, month
) t
WHERE rank = 1;
